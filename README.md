# üìã | Summary

<p>üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Patryk Namyslak, I am a front end web developer, I work with HTML, CSS AND JavaScript. If you want to know more about me keep on reading.</p>

---

# üå± | Intro:

<p>I have been in the field of software development, programming and web design for nearly two years, Within those years I've created a few websites as side projects but my main projects have been my <a href="https://patryknamyslak.pl">personal website</a> & <a href="https://aver.digital">my company website</a>, you can see all of my websites I've built in <a href="https://patryknamyslak.pl/portfolio">My Portfolio</a>.</p>

# üß† | My Mindset:

<p>I am keen on learning more as I proceed further down this route, I am open to constructive criticism on my work, I actually advocate for people to criticize my work, because I know it can't be flawless and it can be improved. Currently I am a semi-beginner/intermediate level in Web design, beginner in Database management, Knowledgeable on running and maintaining a healthy web server via both the front end and the back end, and semi-decent using python.</p>

# üíª | Work Ethic

<p>I am a critical thinker, I break things down in my head before taking anything on, I sometimes don't have a physical plan or wireframe, I just kind of go ahead and want to get my hands dirty and get into the hard rooted coding, designing or just even creating. I like to believe I have a wild imagination when it comes to web design, which is good in my opinion, which a lot of employers would agree on but there are some that don't, so I want to make that clear, that I like to do things my way but the right way, a lot of the time whenever I'm given steps on how to do something I improve the steps and make the final product better than intended, which is just what I'm used to and that's how I work, I don't think too much or dwell on it if you'd like, I just do it.</p>


# üó£Ô∏è | Conclusion
<p>Now that was just a little bit about me, I hope it's not overwhelming, as I am just a six-teen year old who is keen on learning more about the industry and wants to build relationships to then greater my connections for the future. But please don't hold back if you think I should change my Mindset as I stated earlier I am open to criticism and I'm always looking to improve in one way or another.</p>
